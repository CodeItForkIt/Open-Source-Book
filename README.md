# Open-Source-Book
This is a repository for a book that anyone can download, read and edit for free. It's going to be a fun experiment to see where this leads.
**RULES**
  1. No trolling! You may change the grammar of other's additions but otherwise please don't delete them or put random nonsense.
  2. No NSFW content please.
  3. No politics or controversial topics
  4. No real-life counterparts/degradation of real life people please. You can recreate a story as long as it's reasonibly changed so it can't be identified.
  5. No harassing others via the book.

That's it! Happy reading/editing!
